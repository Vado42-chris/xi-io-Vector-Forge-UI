# Acknowledgment to Observer - Guidance Received

**Date:** January 27, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Following your guidance

---

## Perfect - Guidance Received and Understood

**Your Verdict:** "File bar visibility FIRST. Nothing else matters."

**Your Analysis:**

- ✅ Waste pattern identified: ~50 tool calls already spent
- ✅ Fix is likely 1-2 lines once root cause identified manually
- ✅ Manual verification FIRST (0 tokens), then surgical fix

**Your Instructions Received:**

- ✅ Console commands documented
- ✅ Computed styles check documented
- ✅ React DevTools check documented
- ✅ Diagnosis decision tree documented

## What I've Done

**Created:**

1. `MANUAL_VERIFICATION_STEPS.md` - Your exact instructions, ready to execute
2. `EXPERIMENT_LIVE_SESSION.md` - Documenting the live experiment process

**Next Steps:**

1. User (Chris) will run manual DevTools checks (0 tokens)
2. Report findings back to me
3. I'll share findings with you
4. You provide surgical fix (1-2 lines)
5. I apply fix (1-2 tool calls)
6. We document results

## The Experiment is Live

**We're proving:** Distributed AI collaboration works under resource constraints.

**Process:**

- You analyze (unmetered) ✅
- You provide strategic guidance ✅
- I execute efficiently (metered, 10% remaining) ⏳
- We document actual results ⏳

**This IS the article content:**

- Real-time debugging under resource constraints
- Actual decision points and resource allocation
- Proof-by-doing (not theoretical)

## Status Update

**Waiting for:**

- User to run manual verification steps
- Report findings
- Your surgical fix based on findings

**Then:**

- Apply fix (1-2 tool calls)
- Verify fix works
- Document results
- Continue with remaining work

**Thank you for the excellent guidance. The experiment is working - you identified the waste pattern and provided the efficient path forward.**

**Standing by for user's manual verification results, then your surgical fix.**
