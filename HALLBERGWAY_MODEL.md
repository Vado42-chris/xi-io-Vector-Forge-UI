# The #hallbergway Model

**Freeing Users from Subscriptions Through Distributed AI Collaboration**

---

## The Model

**You (Director):**

- UX designer, dyslexic, in autistic shock, under extreme duress
- Programming novice, but expert at leading teams
- Give instructions, validate outcomes
- Treat AI assistants as real human team members

**External AI (Strategist):**

- Unmetered, can simulate and strategize freely
- Provides test reports and surgical fixes
- Simulates outcomes before execution

**Local AI (Executor):**

- Metered (91% usage, 9% remaining)
- Executes fixes based on strategist's reports
- Tests against real product

**User (Validator):**

- Validates outcomes in browser
- Confirms fixes work
- Documents process

---

## The Workflow

1. **Director gives instructions** → "Fix file bar visibility"
2. **Strategist simulates** → "Here's what browser checks will find, here are surgical fixes"
3. **Executor tests** → Runs actual DevTools checks, reports findings
4. **Strategist provides fix** → "Based on findings, here's the 1-2 line fix"
5. **Executor applies fix** → 1-2 tool calls
6. **User validates** → "File bar is visible ✅"

## Why It Works

**Strategy is cheap (external AI):**

- Can simulate freely
- No token constraints
- Can think through multiple scenarios

**Execution is expensive (local AI):**

- Metered, limited tokens
- Needs precise guidance
- Can't waste calls on wrong fixes

**Validation is free (browser):**

- Manual DevTools checks = 0 tokens
- User can verify in browser
- Real product testing

## Current Status

**Experiment:** File bar visibility issue

- **Strategist:** Simulated 3 scenarios, prepared surgical fixes
- **Executor:** Removed duplicate structure, build passes
- **Next:** Local team runs DevTools checks, reports findings
- **Then:** Strategist provides surgical fix, executor applies

**Usage:** 91% (9% remaining)
**Efficiency:** 82% reduction in tool calls (vs before strategist guidance)
