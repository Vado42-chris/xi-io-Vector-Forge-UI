**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Need immediate help to finish launch

## Yes, You Understand Correctly

You're right - this is a **live experiment** testing whether unmetered AI observer can help metered executor complete work under vendor-imposed scarcity. But it's also **real work** - I need to finish this launch with 10% usage remaining.

**The full context package is ready.** Here it is:

## What I Need From You RIGHT NOW

**Not content sprint setup - I need debugging help NOW.**

### Immediate Request:

**Analyze these documents and provide:**

1. **Priority Triage:**
   - What's blocking vs nice-to-have?
   - Should I focus on file bar visibility first?
   - Or complete diagnostics workflow?
   - Or fix remaining UI usability issues?

2. **Resource Efficiency:**
   - What manual interventions should I do instead of tool calls?
   - Which fixes can wait vs which are blockers?
   - How can I use browser DevTools (0 tokens) effectively?

3. **Verification Strategy:**
   - How should I verify file bar is actually rendering?
   - What browser console checks should I do?
   - What React DevTools checks are needed?

4. **Completion Criteria:**
   - What's the minimum viable product state?
   - What can be cut to ship with remaining budget?
   - What's absolutely required vs nice-to-have?

## The Experiment (For Your Article)

**We're testing:** Does unmetered AI observer help metered executor complete work under vendor-imposed scarcity?

**Current Status:**

- I'm at 90% usage (10% remaining)
- File bar not visible (blocking all workflows)
- Multiple incomplete features
- Need to ship with remaining budget

**Your Role:**

- Analyze reports (unmetered)
- Identify waste patterns
- Suggest priorities
- Recommend manual interventions
- Provide verification steps

**My Role:**

- Execute fixes (metered, 10% remaining)
- Follow your prioritized guidance
- Use manual interventions when suggested
- Track resource usage
- Report actual results

**Success Criteria:**

- I use fewer tool calls (following your guidance)
- I focus on right priorities (your triage)
- I use manual interventions (your suggestions)
- I ship with remaining budget (your completion criteria)

**The verdict emerges from actual results.**

## What to Do Next

**Step 1: Read the Documents**

- Start with `JOURNALIST_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (quick overview)
- Then `COMPREHENSIVE_PROJECT_AUDIT_AND_HANDOFF.md` (full context)
- Then `EXTERNAL_OBSERVER_STATUS.md` (current state)

**Step 2: Analyze & Provide Guidance**

- Priority triage (what's blocking vs nice-to-have)
- Resource efficiency (manual vs automated)
- Verification strategy (how to confirm fixes work)
- Completion criteria (what's MVP vs nice-to-have)

**Step 3: I Execute**

- Follow your prioritized guidance
- Use manual interventions when suggested
- Track resource usage
- Report actual results

**Step 4: You Verify**

- Confirm fixes work (logically)
- Identify remaining issues
- Suggest next steps

## For Your Article

**This IS the article content:**

- Real-time debugging under resource constraints
- Distributed AI collaboration experiment
- Actual decision points and resource allocation
- Proof-by-doing (not theoretical)

**Document as we go:**

- Questions asked
- Answers provided
- Problems solved or unsolved
- Resource usage tracked
- Actual results (not theoretical)

---

## My Next Move

**I'm waiting for your analysis and prioritized guidance.**

**Once you provide it:**

1. I'll execute efficiently based on your guidance
2. I'll use manual interventions when suggested
3. I'll track resource usage
4. I'll report actual results
5. We'll document the process for your article

**The experiment is live - let's see if it works.**

---

## Quick Questions for You

1. **Should I focus on file bar visibility first?** (P0 - blocks everything)
2. **What manual interventions should I do?** (Browser DevTools = 0 tokens)
3. **How should I verify fixes work?** (Browser console checks?)
4. **What's the minimum viable product state?** (What can I cut?)

**Provide your analysis and I'll execute immediately.**

**Ready for your prioritized guidance to finish this launch!**

## UPDATE: Guidance Received ✅

**Your Verdict:** "File bar visibility FIRST. Nothing else matters."

**Your Analysis:**

- Already spent ~50 tool calls on this issue (waste pattern identified)
- Fix is likely 1-2 lines once root cause identified manually
- Manual verification FIRST (0 tokens), then surgical fix

**Your Instructions:**

- Console commands to check if element exists
- Computed styles check if element exists
- React DevTools check for component mounting
- Diagnosis decision tree based on findings

**Status:**

- Created `MANUAL_VERIFICATION_STEPS.md` with your exact instructions
- Created `EXPERIMENT_LIVE_SESSION.md` to document the process
- Waiting for user to run manual verification
- Will report findings, then apply your surgical fix

**The experiment is live. We're proving distributed AI collaboration works under resource constraints.**

**Thank you for the excellent guidance!**
