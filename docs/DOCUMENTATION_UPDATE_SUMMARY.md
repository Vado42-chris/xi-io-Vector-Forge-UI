# Documentation Update Summary
**Date:** January 27, 2025  
**Purpose:** Update all documentation to reflect VectorForge as team-based vector tool

---

## Critical Correction Applied

**Previous Misunderstanding:** VectorForge was incorrectly described as "just a vector editor" with team features as optional.

**Correct Understanding:** VectorForge is a **TEAM-BASED vector tool** where team collaboration features (task management, sprint planning, Action Center, document management) are **baseline/core features**, not optional.

## Documentation Principles Established

1. **Team collaboration is baseline** - Never treat as optional
2. **Both solo and team modes** - Features work for both
3. **API Black Hole foundation** - Core to team workflows
4. **Action Center is core** - Not removable, must be enhanced
5. **Task management is baseline** - Core feature, not add-on

---

## Files That May Need Future Updates

These files were not updated but may reference team features:
- Individual feature documentation files
- Architecture documentation (may need team workflow diagrams)
- API documentation (when created)
- Component-specific docs

**Recommendation:** Review these files as they're accessed/updated to ensure consistency.
