# VectorForge Project Status
**Last Updated:** December 28, 2024  
**Version:** 0.0.0 (Pre-Alpha)

## Current State

### What We've Built

VectorForge is a **team-based web vector graphics editor** with animation capabilities, built on React and TypeScript. VectorForge is designed for both solo creators and teams, with team collaboration features as core baseline functionality. We've completed the foundational infrastructure and are now building user-facing features.

**Completed Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Modular architecture with service layer
- ✅ Product registry system
- ✅ Workflow layout management
- ✅ Security & code sandboxing
- ✅ Error logging & intelligence
- ✅ Build system & deployment prep
- ✅ **API Service Layer** - Foundation for API Black Hole systems
- ✅ **Task Management Service** - Core team collaboration infrastructure

**Completed Features:**
- ✅ Basic canvas with SVG rendering
- ✅ Rectangle, ellipse, path drawing
- ✅ Layer management system
- ✅ Animation timeline UI
- ✅ Professional file menu
- ✅ Tool properties panel
- ✅ Error dashboard
- ✅ Layout switching
- ✅ **Task Management** - SprintBoard, TaskCard components
- ✅ **Action Center** - Surfaces highest-priority team actions
- ✅ **Sprint Planning** - Sprint management UI and services
- ✅ **Task-to-VectorForge Linking** - Link tasks to vector items

### What's In Progress

- 🔄 Path editing (node editor needs refinement)
- 🔄 Animation keyframe system (needs interpolation)
- 🔄 Custom tool palettes (drag-drop in progress)
- 🔄 Export system (SVG works, PNG/PDF needed)

### What's Planned

- 📋 Complete drawing tool suite (pen, pencil, brush, etc.)
- 📋 Advanced path operations (boolean, pathfinder)
- 📋 Animation export (video, GIF)
- 📋 Plugin system & marketplace
- 📋 Enhanced team collaboration (real-time collaboration, multi-user editing)
- 📋 USB installer/deployment

## Development Progress

**Codebase Stats:**
- 51 React components
- 29 service modules
- 5 major patches completed
- Build succeeds (7 TypeScript warnings, non-blocking)

**Recent Work:**
- Completed Patches 1-5 (Foundation, Registry, Layouts, Security, Error Logging)
- Fixed major build issues
- Integrated error handling system
- Added workflow layout system

## Next Priorities

1. **Complete Core Drawing Tools** - Enable users to actually create content
2. **Fix Export System** - Users need to save their work
3. **Polish Animation** - Make timeline fully functional
4. **User Documentation** - Help users understand the tool
5. **Testing** - Ensure stability before release

## Known Issues

- Some TypeScript type warnings (non-blocking)
- Limited drawing tool options
- Export formats incomplete
- Animation interpolation missing
- No test coverage

## Release Timeline

**Target:** MVP Release Q2 2025  
**Current Phase:** Core feature development  
**Blockers:** None - development proceeding
