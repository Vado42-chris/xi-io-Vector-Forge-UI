# VectorForge User Guide
**For Everyone - Especially Beginners**

## Welcome to VectorForge!

VectorForge is a **team-based vector graphics editor** - a tool for creating digital art, illustrations, and animations, designed for both solo creators and teams. If you've never used software like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape, don't worry! This guide will help you get started.

**Team Features:** VectorForge includes built-in task management, sprint planning, and collaboration tools. Whether you're working alone or with a team, these features help you stay organized and productive.

## What is Vector Graphics?

**Vector graphics** are images made of shapes, lines, and curves - not pixels. This means:
- ✅ You can resize them without losing quality
- ✅ They're perfect for logos, icons, and illustrations
- ✅ File sizes are usually smaller
- ✅ You can edit every part of the image

Think of it like building with LEGO blocks - you can move, resize, and change each piece.

## Getting Started

### Your First Drawing

1. **Open VectorForge** - The app loads in your web browser
2. **Create a New File** - Click "File" → "New" (or press `Ctrl+N`)
3. **Choose a Tool** - Click a tool in the left sidebar (try the Rectangle tool)
4. **Draw on Canvas** - Click and drag on the white canvas area
5. **See Your Shape** - A rectangle appears!

### The Interface

**Top Bar (File Menu)**
- File operations (New, Open, Save, Export)
- Edit options (Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, Paste)
- View controls (Zoom, Rulers)
- Window management

**Left Sidebar (Tools)**
- Drawing tools (Pen, Rectangle, Ellipse, etc.)
- Selection tools
- Navigation tools (Zoom, Pan)

**Right Sidebar (Properties)**
- Tool properties (colors, stroke width, etc.)
- Layer management

## Basic Concepts

### Layers

**Layers** are like transparent sheets stacked on top of each other. Each layer can contain shapes, and you can:
- Reorder layers (move up/down)
- Show/hide layers
- Lock layers (prevent editing)
- Group layers together

**Why use layers?**
- Organize your artwork
- Edit parts separately
- Control what's visible

### Tools

**Selection Tool** (`V`)
- Click objects to select them
- Move selected objects
- Resize with handles

**Rectangle Tool** (`M`)
- Draw rectangles and squares
- Hold `Shift` for perfect squares

**Ellipse Tool** (`L`)
- Draw circles and ovals
- Hold `Shift` for perfect circles

**Pen Tool** (`P`)
- Draw custom paths
- Click to place points
- Create curves and lines

**Text Tool** (`T`)
- Add text to your artwork
- Click canvas to place text

### Properties

When you select an object, you can change:
- **Fill Color** - The inside color
- **Stroke Color** - The outline color
- **Stroke Width** - How thick the outline is
- **Opacity** - How transparent it is

## Common Tasks

### Creating a Simple Logo

1. Draw a shape (rectangle, circle, etc.)
2. Change the fill color
3. Add text with the Text tool
4. Arrange elements
5. Group layers together
6. Export as SVG or PNG

### Making an Animation

1. Create your artwork
2. Open the Timeline (bottom panel)
3. Add a keyframe at frame 0
4. Move to frame 10
5. Move or change your object
6. Add another keyframe
7. Press Play to see animation

### Saving Your Work

**Save Project** (`Ctrl+S`)
- Saves as `.xibalba` file
- Keeps all layers and properties
- Can reopen later

**Export as SVG**
- For web use
- Scalable vector format
- Edit in other programs

**Export as PNG** (coming soon)
- For images
- Fixed size
- Good for sharing

## Understanding the Development Cycle

### Why Some Features Are Missing

VectorForge is actively being developed. You might notice:
- Some tools are placeholder buttons
- Some features say "coming soon"
- The interface might change

**This is normal!** The app is being built in phases:
1. ✅ Core infrastructure (done)
2. 🔄 Basic features (in progress)
3. 📋 Advanced features (planned)

### How Development Works

1. **Planning** - Decide what to build
2. **Building** - Write code and create features
3. **Testing** - Make sure it works
4. **Fixing** - Solve problems
5. **Releasing** - Make it available

You're using VectorForge during the "Building" phase!

### Your Feedback Matters

If you find:
- Bugs or errors
- Confusing features
- Missing functionality
- Things that don't work

This helps improve the app! The Error Dashboard collects information to help fix issues.
