# Loki-PC Framework Analysis - What I've Learned

## 🔍 Exploration Status

Exploring the comprehensive framework structure on Loki-PC to understand the full architecture.

## 📁 Framework Structure Discovered

### Main Framework Directory
**Location**: `/home/chrishallberg/drives/hdd1/Xibalba-Projects/Xibalba-Framework-V61/`

### Key Components Found

1. **`_00-xibalba-framework/`** - Core framework
   - Deep nested structure
   - Core modules and managers
   - Framework foundation

2. **`xibalba-intranet/`** - Intranet server (already explored)
   - Flask application
   - Python-based
   - Server-side rendering

3. **Other Repos** - Multiple framework-related projects
   - Started but unfinished
   - Different approaches
   - Experimental implementations

## 🎯 What I'm Learning

### Architecture Patterns

1. **Nested Structure**
   - Deep directory nesting (`_00-xibalba-framework/core/_00-xibalba/_00-odin-studio/`)
   - Organized by layers/levels
   - Modular design

2. **Python-Based Core**
   - Flask for web services
   - Python managers for core functionality
   - File-based data storage

3. **Multiple Approaches**
   - Different repos = different experiments
   - Learning from each attempt
   - Iterative development

### Key Insights

1. **Framework Evolution**
   - Multiple versions/attempts
   - Learning from failures
   - Building on what works

2. **Modular Design**
   - Core framework separate from applications
   - Managers for different functions
   - Pluggable architecture

3. **Integration Focus**
   - Cursor bridge integration
   - Local AI integration
   - Server management integration

## 📊 Comparison: Loki-PC vs Aries-PC

| Aspect | Loki-PC | Aries-PC |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Core Framework** | Python (Flask) | React/TypeScript |
| **Architecture** | Server-side | Client-side |
| **Data Storage** | File-based | Services + API |
| **Rendering** | Templates | JSX components |
| **Integration** | Network bridge | Settings-based |

## 🔍 What I Need to Explore Further

1. **Core Framework Structure**
   - `_00-xibalba-framework/` organization
   - Core managers and modules
   - Framework foundation

2. **Alpaca Workspace**
   - What is it?
   - How does it relate to framework?
   - What's its purpose?

3. **Original Workspace**
   - First implementation?
   - What worked/didn't work?
   - Lessons learned?

4. **Other Repos**
   - What each repo attempted
   - Why they were abandoned
   - What can be salvaged?

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deep Dive into Core Framework**
   - Explore `_00-xibalba-framework/` structure
   - Understand core managers
   - Document architecture

2. **Analyze Alpaca Workspace**
   - Purpose and design
   - Integration points
   - Unique features

3. **Review Other Repos**
   - Catalog what exists
   - Identify useful code
   - Plan integration

4. **Create Unified Architecture**
   - Combine best from all versions
   - Design merge strategy
   - Plan implementation
